# Xamarin-POC
1. Used Xamarin Forms.<br />
2. Used MVVM pattern by Implementing the Base ViewModel and moving all the UI logic to the viewmodel. So that it will be easier to do Unit testing and loose coupling of UI from the backend.<br />
3. SQLite integration with user service and user Repository for User CRUD operations. <br /> 
4. Used the Xamarin dependency Service to initialize the User repository.
